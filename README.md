<h1> README Generator </h1>

In this assignment I created a command line application to generate a README file. I utilized Node Modules (NPM), Inquirer and package.json. 

## Actions taken:
* Utilized Inquirer package to prompt the user with a series of questions (project name, description, etc.) via the command-line interface. 
* Included a "list" prompt to allow the user to select a license. 
* Utilized the "writefile" function to write the inputs onto the README. 
* Utilized the "init" function to initilize the application. 
* Utilized the licenseLink function so that the license selected will display as a badge on the read me. 
* Utilized the generate markdown function to display the inputted information in an organized and professional manner.
